Frequency of backups depends on machine usecase (home pc? server?).
If the machine is a database, it's probably a good idea to have hourly or at least daily backups.
For home PC's it's probably ok to have monthly backups of important files, like pictures and documents.

Crontab entries:
0 2 * * * backup-critical.sh mirror #Schedule critical files backup daily at 2AM.
0 2 * * sun  backup-other.sh mirror #Schedule other files backup every Sunday at 2AM.
@monthly maketar.sh #Schedule archiving of backup in the first minute of every month.
